🔹 Web Security Scanner: Project Overview

🛡️ What is this project?

The Web Security Scanner is a powerful cybersecurity tool designed to detect vulnerabilities in web applications through automated passive and active security scanning. It mimics real-world penetration testing techniques to uncover risks such as SQL Injection (SQLi) 🛠️, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) 🔥, and misconfigured security headers 🔒.

By integrating automated web crawling 🔍, custom security payloads 🎯, and OWASP ZAP integration ⚡, this scanner helps identify security flaws and generates detailed reports 📊 for further analysis.

🛡️ Why was this project created?

Cyber threats are increasing every day, and web applications are a prime target for hackers. This project was built to help security professionals, ethical hackers, and developers detect vulnerabilities before attackers do.

💡 Automate Web Security Testing: Manually checking for security flaws can be slow and inefficient. This tool automates the process, making security assessments faster and more effective 🚀.

📚 Enhance Cybersecurity Skills: Designed for learning and research, this project provides hands-on experience in ethical hacking and penetration testing 🔥.

🛑 Prevent Cyber Attacks Before They Happen: Finding and fixing security vulnerabilities early helps protect businesses and users from potential cyber threats.

🚀 Build a Professional Cybersecurity Portfolio: Showcasing this project highlights expertise in web security, vulnerability detection, and Python automation.

🛡️ How can this project be used in real life?

👨‍💻 Penetration Testing: Security professionals can use this tool to scan and analyze websites, finding vulnerabilities before attackers do.

💰 Bug Bounty Hunting: Ethical hackers can automate reconnaissance and vulnerability detection to participate in bug bounty programs 💸.

🏢 Enterprise Security Audits: Businesses can use this scanner to test their own web applications and improve security posture.

🎓 Cybersecurity Education & Research: Perfect for students, cybersecurity enthusiasts, and professionals looking to develop offensive security skills 🔥.

🛡️ How does it work?

🕵️ Web Crawling: The scanner starts by extracting all links from the target website to map out the attack surface.

🔍 Passive Security Scanning: It checks for misconfigured security headers, open ports, SSL/TLS weaknesses, and other basic security flaws.

🎯 Active Vulnerability Scanning: The tool simulates real attacks like SQL Injection, XSS, and parameter tampering to uncover weaknesses.

📊 Report Generation: A detailed security report is generated in JSON and HTML formats, making it easy to analyze and fix vulnerabilities.
